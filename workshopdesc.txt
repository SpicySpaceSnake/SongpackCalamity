[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
Song mods are bafflingly simple and do nothing except stick .abc files in the 'songs' folder.
The most breakage you'll get is if another mod happens to also have a song file with the exact same name. In this case, the mod that loads last will simply override it.
